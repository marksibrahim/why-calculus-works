# Complex Plane

Why Complex Numbers? As Bombelli pondered the solutions to $$x^3 = 5x + 3$$, he discovered it's useful to consider not just real number, but complex numbers too. The set of complex numbers, $$\mathbb{C}$$, is called the **Complex Plane**. We can think of the complex plane, as a set of points $$x + i y$$ where

$$x, y \in \mathbb{R}$$â€”in other words, as numbers in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.

## Arithmetic 

## Polar Coordinates

We can express a complex number $$z$$ \(often z, w denoted complex numbers\), using **polar coordinates**: a length and an angle. Often we write it as, $$z = r\(\cos\(\theta\) + i \sin\(theta\)\)$$ \($$\theta $$ is the angle; $$r$$ is the length\). Here we consider $$z$$ to be a value in the complex plane, where the imaginary axis replaces the typical $$y$$ axis in the real plane.
