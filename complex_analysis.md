# Complex Analysis

# Complex Plane

Why Complex Numbers? As Bombelli pondered the solutions to $$x^3 = 5x + 3$$, he discovered it's useful to consider not just real number, but complex numbers too. The set of complex numbers, $$\mathbb{C}$$, is called the **Complex Plane**. We can think of the complex plane, as a set of points $$x + i y$$ where

$$x, y \in \mathbb{R}$$â€”in other words, as numbers in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.

## Arithmetic

## Polar Coordinates

We can express a complex number $$z$$ \(often z, w denoted complex numbers\), using **polar coordinates**: a length and an angle. Often we write it as, $$z = r(\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta))$$ \($$\theta $$ is the angle; $$r$$ is the length\). Here we consider $$z$$ to be a value in the complex plane, where the imaginary axis replaces the typical $$y$$ axis in the real plane.

> e.g., Arg\(1 - i\) = $$\frac{-\pi}{4}$$



* a **principal argument **is one where $$\theta$$ is between $$\pi, -\pi$$.



**De Moivre's Formula: **$$e^{i\theta}^n = e^{in\theta}$$. In the land of sines and cosines, this becomes:

$$ \cos\(\theta\) + i sin\(\theta\) = \cos\(n \theta\) + i \sin\(n \theta\)$$
