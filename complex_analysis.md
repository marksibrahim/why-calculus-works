# Complex Analysis

Why Complex Numbers? As Bombelli pondered the solutions to $$x^3 = 5x + 3$$, he discovered it's useful to consider not just real number, but complex numbers too. The set of complex numbers, $$\mathbb{C}$$, is called the **Complex Plane**. We can think of the complex plane, as a set of points $$x + i y$$ where 

$$x, y \in \mathbb{R}$$â€”in other words, as numbers in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.
