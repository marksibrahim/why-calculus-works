# Complex Plane

Why Complex Numbers? As Bombelli pondered the solutions to $$x^3 = 5x + 3$$, he discovered it's useful to consider not just real number, but complex numbers too. The set of complex numbers, $$\mathbb{C}$$, is called the **Complex Plane**. We can think of the complex plane, as a set of points $$x + i y$$ where $$x, y \in \mathbb{R}$$. In other words, we can think of complex numbers as numbers in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.



## Polar Coordinates

We can express complex numbers \(denoted usually as z or w\), using polar coordinates: a length and angle. Often we write $$z$$ as

$$z = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)$$

* angle is often called the **argument **
  * a **principal argument **is one where $$\theta$$ is between $$\pi, -\pi$$.


> e.g., Arg\(1 - i\) = $$\frac{- \pi}{4}$$

The lenght of numbers in the complex plane, called the **modulus, **is computed as: $$\| z \| = \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 }$$ 

**De Moivre's Formula**

Since we know** **$$(e^{i\theta})^n = e^{i n \theta}$$ and that $$e^{i \theta} = cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)$$ \(Euler's Formula\),  De Moivre's Formula is the observation that:

$$\cos(\theta) + i sin(\theta) = \cos(n \theta) + i \sin(n \theta)$$

> $$e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$$, because the real and imaginary parts of $$e^{i x}$$ correspond to the power series of $$\cos$$ and $$\sin$$.

## Nth Roots

An nth root of a complex number, $$w$$, is a number $$z$$ such that $$z^n = w$$. An important type of nth root are the **nth roots of unity**, which are numbers whose nth power is 1.

> Let's think in polar coordinates: $$r e^{i n \theta} = 1 $$. Then r =1 and $$n \theta = 2 \pi k $$ for k $$\in \mathbb{Z}$$. We then have $$\theta = 0, 2 \pi / n, 4 \pi / n, \dots$$ there are n unique angles!



We can think of other nth roots as roots of unity corrected for length.
