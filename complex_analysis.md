# Complex Analysis

# Complex Plane

Why Complex Numbers? As Bombelli pondered the solutions to $$x^3 = 5x + 3$$, he discovered it's useful to consider not just real number, but complex numbers too. The set of complex numbers, $$\mathbb{C}$$, is called the **Complex Plane**. We can think of the complex plane, as a set of points $$x + i y$$ where $$x, y \in \mathbb{R}$$. In other words, we can think of complex numbers as numbers in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.

## Polar Coordinates

We can express complex numbers \(denoted usually as z or w\), using polar coordinates: a length and angle. Often we write $$z$$ as

$$z = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)$$

* angle is often called the **argument **
  * a **principal argument **is one where $$\theta$$ is between $$\pi, -\pi$$.


**De Moivre's Formula: **$$(e^{i\theta})^n = e^{i n \theta}$$. In the land of sines and cosines, this becomes:

$$\cos(\theta) + i sin(\theta) = \cos(n \theta) + i \sin(n \theta)$$

> e.g., Arg\(1 - i\) = $$\frac{-\pi}{4}$$
