# Real Analysis

This will begin with a description of real numbers, completeness, compactness, and some topologyâ€”ultimately leading to integration and differentiation.

## Real Numbers

These are the numbers you and I know: 0, 1, -1, 1.5, and even $$\pi$$. 
**Rational** numbers are ones we can represent as an integer divided by another.
It turns out many numbers are **irrational** including $$\pi$$, $$\sqrt{2}$$, $$\sqrt{3}$$, and $$\sqrt{n}$$ for
any $$n$$ that's not a perfect square \($$\neq$$ a number squared\).

> **Idea**: use divisibility to show no rational number squared is 2.
> 
> 1. if $$\sqrt{2} = a / b$$, then $$ 2 = a^2 / b^2$$ $$\implies a^2$$ is divisible by 2 
> 2. So $$a$$ must be divisible by 2, implying $$b^2$$ is also divisible by 2, a contradiction!

More abstractly, the real numbers are uniquely determined by a handful of natural **requirements** on a set:

* **field** \(operations: +, x with dentity, inverses, commutiativity, associativity, and distribution\)
* **order**: trichotomy \(either &gt;, &lt; or =\)
* **completeness** \(= least upper bound property\)
  * every set with an upper bound has a _least_ upper bound.
  * e.g., \(0, 1\) has 1 as an upper bound, but 1 is not in the set \(0, 1\)


A nice consequence of this is the **triangle inequality: **$$ \| x + y \| \leq \|x\| + \|y\|$$ for any $$x, y \in \mathbb{R}$$.

> **Idea**: look at cases where x, y are positive \(Spivak has a nice proof of this\)

It turns out even in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, a nice property about order called **Cauchy Schwarz** holds:


$$
|\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} | 
\leq 
|\vec{u}| | \vec{v} |
$$

> 
> $$(x_1, x_2, x_3) \cdot (y_1, y_2, y_3) = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + x_3y_3$$

Finally, how many real numbers are there? 
Cantor showed there are actually uncountably many---you can never come up with a way to write a list of all real numbers even if you had all the time in the world.

> **Idea**: suppose someone claimed to have a list of all reals \(this list would have to be infinite\). Then, we write down a number that's different from each one on the list in the nth decimal place

Nevertheless, the set of rationals is countable. Make a table:

This is a great [TedEd video](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-big-is-infinity) discussing infinity and the reals.

## Topology

We can define a more general way to measure distance between two points in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ \(or any vector space actually\), called a **norm**, denoted \|\| \* \|\|.

A norm is \(for $$x, y in \mathbb{R}^n$$\):

1. _positive_ \(\|\|x\|\| &gt; 0, for all x in the set\); _definite_ \|\| x \|\| = 0 if and only if x =0

2. \|\|ax\|\| = a\|\|x\|\|, for any a in $$\mathbb{C}$$

3. _triangle_: $$ \| x + y \| \leq \| x \| + \| y \| $$


Common examples are euclidean distance \(L2 norm\), Taxi Cab \(L1 norm\), and sup-norm \(returns the peak value across all dimesions of vector\).

> remember **vectors spaces** are sets with nice properties about addition and scalar multiplication

Norms in this context will later generalize to classes of functions with nice integration properties in measure theory.

> \(\sum_i \| x\_i \|^p\)^{1/p}

> In the case of L2, p = 2 \(this will show up again in measure theory\).

With a notion of distance \(often, we use L2 or Euclidean distance\), we can define **neighborhoods** or **open balls** around a point:

**B\(x; r\) **is a ball of radius r around x = set of points which are within a distance r of x \(strictly &lt; here\)
