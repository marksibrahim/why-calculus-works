This will begin with a description of real numbers, completeness, compactness, and some topology--ultimately leading to integration and differentiation. 

## Real Numbers

These are the numbers you and I know: 0, 1, -1, 1.5, and even $\pi$. 
**Rational** numbers are ones we can represent as an integer divided by another.
It turns out many numbers are **irrational** including $$\pi$$, $$\sqrt{2}$$, $$\sqrt{3}$$, and $$\sqrt{n}$$ for
any $$n$$ that's not a perfect square ($$\neq$$ a number squared). 

> idea: use divisibility to show no rational number squared is 2. 

>  1. if $$\sqrt{2} = a / b$$, then $$ 2 = a^2 / b^2$$ $$\implies$$ $a^2$ is divisible by 2 
>  2. So $$a$$ must be divisible by 2, implying $$b^2$$ is also divisible by 2, a contradiction!

More abstractly, the real numbers are uniquely determined by a handful of natural requirements on a set:
* field (operations: +, x with dentity, inverses, commutiativity, associativity, and distribution)
* order: trichotomy (either >, < or =)
* completeness (or equivalent least upper bound property)
  * this says, every set that has an upper bound has a *least* upper bound.

It turns out even in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, a nice property about order called **Cauchy Schwarz** holds:

$$|\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} | 
\leq 
|\vec{u}| | \vec{v} | $$
