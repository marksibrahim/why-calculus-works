# Real Analysis

This will begin with a description of real numbers, completeness, compactness, and some topologyâ€”ultimately leading to integration and differentiation. 

## Real Numbers

These are the numbers you and I know: 0, 1, -1, 1.5, and even $\pi$. 
**Rational** numbers are ones we can represent as an integer divided by another.
It turns out many numbers are **irrational** including $$\pi$$, $$\sqrt{2}$$, $$\sqrt{3}$$, and $$\sqrt{n}$$ for
any $$n$$ that's not a perfect square ($$\neq$$ a number squared). 

> idea: use divisibility to show no rational number squared is 2. 

>  if $$\sqrt{2} = a / b$$, then $$ 2 = a^2 / b^2$$ $$\implies$$ $a^2$ is divisible by 2.

  > this means $$a$$ must be divisible by 2
  > so we get that $$b^2$$ is also divisible by 2, a contradiction
