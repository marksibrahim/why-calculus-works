# Why Calculus Works

_Understanding Calculus through real analysis, complex analysis, and measure theory_

Because we so often forget material we learn, I'm recording my understanding of analysis here.

**Outline**:

* Real Analysis

  * Real numbers
  * Topology: open, compact, connected
  * Functions, limits and continuity
  * Differentiation: mean value, Taylor,
  * Series and convergence
  * Integration


Althought dry, Apostol's _Mathematical Analysis_ is a helpful reference.

* Complex Analysis (start with Weselyan notes)
  * Complex plane
  * ...
