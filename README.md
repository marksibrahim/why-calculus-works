# Why Calculus Works

_Understanding Calculus through real analysis, complex analysis, and measure theory_

Because we so often forget material we learn, I'm recording my understanding of analysis here.

**Outline**:

* Real Analysis

  * real numbers
  * topology
  * limits and continuity
  * differentiation
  * integration


* Complex Analysis \(start with Weselyan notes\)
  * complex plane


Althought dry, Apostol's _Mathematical Analysis_ is a helpful reference.
