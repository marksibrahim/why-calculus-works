# Why Calculus Works

a compendium of real analysis, complex analysis and measure theory 

Because we so often forget material we learn, I'm recording my understanding of analysis here. 

When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
