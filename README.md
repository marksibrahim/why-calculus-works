# Why Calculus Works

Analysis: real, complex and measure theoretic as way to understand Calculus

Because we so often forget material we learn, I'm recording my understanding of analysis here.

**Outline**:

* Real Analysis

  * real numbers
  * topology
  * 

* Complex Analysis \(start with Weselyan notes\)

  * complex plane



Althought dry, Apostol's _Mathematical Analysis_ is a helpful reference.
